Car Sales Analysis using Power BI and Excel

A complete data-driven dashboard project that provides actionable insights into car sales performance across various dimensions like time, body style, color, and dealer region. Built using Excel for data preparation and Power BI for visualization and business analysis.


Project Objective

Our car dealership lacked a centralized, data-driven system to monitor and analyze sales performance. To address this, we built a dynamic Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into:

Total sales

Cars sold

Average selling price

Performance across dealers, models, and body styles


This dashboard helps leadership track KPIs, identify trends, and make informed business decisions.
